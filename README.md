This project is a **Java Spring Boot** application designed to manage student records with a strong focus on **security** and **role-based access control**. It uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to authenticate users and secure sensitive API endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users have access based on their roles.

The complete source code for the system, including authentication, authorization, CRUD operations, and database integration, is available [here](https://github.com/Adiorahonu1/S-M-S__JWT_AUTHENTICATION).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Secure JWT Authentication**: Authenticate users with signed tokens to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Differentiate user permissions (e.g., Admin vs. User) to control access levels within the system.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete student records through a clean and scalable RESTful API.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Deliver clear, consistent error responses for better user experience and debugging.
- **Relational Database Integration**: Persist student data with seamless connection to a **MySQL** database.
